### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install the following command inside the project directory:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.3.1"
php composer.phar install
~~~

Create a virtual host like this assuming you are using xampp at location
~~~
C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts
~~~

~~~
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
  DocumentRoot C:/xampp/htdocs/basic/web
  ServerName gstinvoice.udev.com

  <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/basic/web">
    # use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
    RewriteEngine on
    # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
    RewriteRule . index.php

    # ...other settings...
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
~~~

The project directory in this case will be C:/xampp/htdocs/basic/

c:/windows/drivers/etc/hosts
